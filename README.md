elm-tile-game
=============

A tile game written in elm. If there is enough interest I will extract the tile map stuff for others to use.
This game loads in [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) maps (only isometric right now) and renders them in the 
correct order on screen. (Snaking right to left from the back). While this does have an implementation for
isometric tilemaps, this is mainly a toy project and is probably better to just make the game in 3D.
